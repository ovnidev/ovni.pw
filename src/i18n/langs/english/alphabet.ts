                    These alphabets are used when creating passwords. From here, you can delete, modify or create new alphabets that suit your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You must be careful when modifying an alphabet because if you have generated a password with an alphabet and then modify it, the password will also be modified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Passwords are generated by creating a hash including the alphabet identifier, in addition to using the characters of the alphabet in the length and order they are in. Therefore, modifying an alphabet would completely change the generated passwords.
                </p>
